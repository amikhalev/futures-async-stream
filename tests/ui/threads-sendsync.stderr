   = help: the trait `std::marker::Send` is not implemented for `dyn futures_core::stream::Stream<Item = i32>`
   = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `std::marker::Send` for `std::ptr::Unique<dyn futures_core::stream::Stream<Item = i32>>`
   = note: required because it appears within the type `std::boxed::Box<dyn futures_core::stream::Stream<Item = i32>>`
